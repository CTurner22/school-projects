#Prime Numbers
This script will take integar inputs from the user until the user enters 0, then print out all the user entries that were prime numbers. This is implemented recursively. 

#LCM
Script will take two integars as input and calulate the least common multiple of those numbers.


#Unique Numbers
Will take in a number and return the count of unique base numbers in it. Example: 998877 -> 3


#Count 1s and 0s
Script will take any positive integar as input from user, then return the number of 1s and 0s in the 32 bit binary representation of that number.


#Collatz Conjecture
Script will take any positive integar as input from user, then step through the collatz conjecture until it hits 1. It will output the number of steps required.


#BinaryFunction
Function will convert a binary word into decimal


#Memory Access
Script will take and index value as input, then output the value of an array at that index.
It will then sum the values on either side of that index and store the sum in the origin index.




All MIPS files were created with and assemble within the MARS simulator.
