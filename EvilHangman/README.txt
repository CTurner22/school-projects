collaberation: n/a

Challenges: while trying to loop through set and erase words, it would erease the next iterator as well (I think) 
and throw an error. I had to just save the entry in a temp variable and erase it in the next loop iteration.

like/dislike: I liked how fun the program actually was, the game cheating itself was a cool concept I thought.

Time spent: 3 hrs
