# School-Projects

I added a couple of my favorite school projects to this repo.



# Evil Hangman
This project reads a dictionary text file into a set and will play hangman with you. However, it will constantly 
change the word based on your guesses to cheat the game making it very difficult to beat. 


# Twenty Questions
This project impliments a binary tree to guess an animal in twenty questions. It base knowledge starts with a couple of (y/n) questions and anwsers stored in a txt file
and will "learn" by adding to the `animal.txt` file everytime the user wins. 


# Algorithms_TSP
This project solves the traveling salesman problem with the nearest neighbor approach and with the exahuastive approach. It then tests and times the 
algorithms with either an input file or a with a random point generator. The requirement of this project was to prove the theoretical big O of each algorithm.
